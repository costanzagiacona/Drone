# Drone â€“ Control via Forwarding

This repository contains a project developed for the course **Analysis and Synthesis of Nonlinear Systems**.  
The project focuses on the **study and simulation of drone control** using **nonlinear control techniques**. In particular, it implements the **Forwarding approach**, which allows stabilizing an extended dynamical system without solving complex PDEs for the Lyapunov function.

The project includes:
- Drone models
- MATLAB/Simulink scripts for simulation
- Stability analysis using Lyapunov functions
- Controller design using the Forwarding method

The main objective is to demonstrate how, starting from a simplified dynamic model, it is possible to design a controller that guarantees **state convergence** and **stabilization of the desired manifold**.
